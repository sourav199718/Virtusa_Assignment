# Virtusa_Assignment

Candidate should create a Spring Boot web application for employee data management:

The application, when launched, should open a login page (use Spring Boot Security).

After login, the second page should display a list of employees (along with the department each employee belongs to).

The list page mentioned above should have the ability to add, edit, and delete employees.

A different page (third page) should be created to add/edit departments.

All interactions from the UI to display or modify data should be done using REST services created within the same Spring Boot application.

All CRUD operations should be done using Spring Data JPA, and the database can be any of the candidateâ€™s choice (Oracle, MySQL, H2).

The UI can be developed using any technology (JSP, HTML), as preferred by the candidate.

Candidates should upload this code in a public Git repository.
